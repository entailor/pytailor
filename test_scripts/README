These scripts are used for integration testing of Tailor.

Two run scripts are used to execute the tests:
    1. run_test_scripts_direct.py
       This script must be run with the "Run file in python console" command in PyCharm.
    2. run_test_scripts_distributed.py
       This script must be executed i two parts:
           - The first part runs the workflows in distributed mode
           - The second part makes assertions on the completed workflows
       This requires that a Tailor worker is running in the /test_scripts directory
       with worker_name set equal to the worker name defined in the script

Notes:
    - some assertions will currently fail with non-Windows workers due to use of file
      path string representations.
