# pyTailor - A python client for Tailor.wf

## Get started
To get started with pyTailor please visit the [documentation]() (this link is not working
yet) pages.

## Installation

Currently, pyTailor can be installed with pip using a .whl file. This file can either be
built directly form the dev environment as shown [below](#building) with (replacing `x.y.z`
with the actual version):

`pip install dist/tailor-x.y.z-py3-none-any.wheel`

Or, you can install from a github release (replacing `x.y.z` with the actual version):

`pip install https://github.com/entailor/pytailor/releases/download/vx.y.z/pytailor-x.y.z-py3-none-any.whl`

## Development

### Setup
This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for dependency management and
packaging.

To set up a development environment simply run `poetry install` from the project root
directory. You can also try the (experimental)
[Poetry plugin](https://koxudaxi.github.io/poetry-pycharm-plugin/) for PyCharm.

### Code generation
Resource data models used with the Tailor REST API are autogenerated using
[datamodel-code-generator](https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator).
To update the data models, make sure openapi.json are up to date with the latest backend
version and run:

`datamodel-codegen --input openapi.json --output src/pytailor/models.py`

### Testing
pyTailor uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for unit testing. To run tests
with coverage report run:
 
`pytest --cov=tailor tests`

### Versioning

pyTailor uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

### Building
pyTailor can be built with:

`poetry build`

This results in the following files (where `x.y.z` is the package version):

`dist/tailor-x.y.z.tar.gz`

`dist/tailor-x.y.z-py3-none-any.wheel`
