# pytailor - python API for Tailor.wf

## Development
### Setup
This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for dependency management and packaging.

To set up a development environment simply run `poetry install` from the project root directory.

### Code generation
Resource data models in tailor.models are autogenerated using [datamodel-code-generator](https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator). To update the datamodels, make sure openapi.json are up to date with the latest backend version and run:

`datamodel-codegen --input openapi.json --output tailor\models.py`
